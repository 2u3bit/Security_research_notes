# Day 4: MITRE ATT&CK TECHNIQUES: **PHISHING**
Adversaries may send victims emails containing malicious attachments or links, typically designed to execute malicious code on the victim's system. 

Phishing can also be conducted via third-party services, such as social media platforms. Additionally, phishing may involve social engineering techniques, like posing as a trusted source, and evasive techniques, such as removing or manipulating emails or metadata/headers from compromised accounts being abused to send messages. 

Another tactic used by adversaries is forging or spoofing the identity of the sender, which can deceive both the human recipient and automated security tools. Before we dive into the depths of the Phishing technique, let me speak about *social engineering*...

## What is social engineering?
Social engineering is any manipulation technique that exploits human behavior and error to gain access to sensitive or confidential information. While some scammers might steal someoneâ€™s personal information, social engineers convince their victims to willingly hand over the requested information, such as usernames and passwords.
