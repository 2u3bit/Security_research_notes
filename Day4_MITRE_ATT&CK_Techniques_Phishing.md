# Day 4: MITRE ATT&CK TECHNIQUES: **PHISHING**
Adversaries may send victims emails containing malicious attachments or links, typically designed to execute malicious code on the victim's system. 

Phishing can also be conducted via third-party services, such as social media platforms. Additionally, phishing may involve social engineering techniques, like posing as a trusted source, and evasive techniques, such as removing or manipulating emails or metadata/headers from compromised accounts being abused to send messages. 

Another tactic used by adversaries is forging or spoofing the identity of the sender, which can deceive both the human recipient and automated security tools. Before we dive into the depths of the Phishing technique, let me speak about *social engineering*...

## What is social engineering?
Social engineering is any manipulation technique that exploits human behavior and error in order to gain access to sensitive or confidential information. While some scammers might steal someoneâ€™s personal information, social engineers convince their victims to willingly hand over the requested information, such as usernames and passwords.


## Types of social engineering:

**Phishing**:
Phishing scams are the most common type of social engineering attack. They typically take the form of an email that looks as if it is from a legitimate source. Sometimes, attackers will attempt to coerce the victim into giving away credit card information or other personal data. At other times, phishing emails are sent to obtain employee login information or other details for use in an advanced attack against their company. Cybercrime attacks such as [Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/advanced-persistent-threat.html) and [ransomware](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/learn/topics/security/what-is-ransomware.html#tabs-35d568e0ff-item-194f491212-tab) often start with phishing attempts.
