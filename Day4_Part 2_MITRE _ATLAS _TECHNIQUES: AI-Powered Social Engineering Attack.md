# Day4: AI-Powered Social Engineering Attacks

Social engineering tricks individuals into disclosing confidential information or providing system access. In the past, this often involved tactics like phishing emails or pretending to be someone in authority. Nowadays, with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), social engineering has advanced significantly. 

AI can craft highly personalized scams, generate convincing fake identities, and even engage in realistic conversations using chatbots.

Imagine receiving a video call from your CEO, urgently instructing you to transfer funds to a new account to finalize a crucial business deal. Everything—from the voice and mannerisms to the background—appears entirely genuine.

In reality, this is not your CEO but a highly sophisticated deepfake created by cyber criminals using artificial intelligence. This scenario exemplifies a rising threat in cybersecurity: AI-driven social engineering attacks.

These attacks leverage artificial intelligence to enhance traditional social engineering techniques, making them more effective and harder to identify. AI enables cybercriminals to create highly realistic and personalized deceptions, blurring the distinction between legitimate and fraudulent communications.

While traditional social engineering relies on exploiting human psychology by imitating trusted figures or organizations, AI introduces an unprecedented level of realism. Advances in machine learning and deep learning allow for the creation of convincing fake content, such as deepfake videos and voice imitations, which significantly heightens the effectiveness of these attacks.
