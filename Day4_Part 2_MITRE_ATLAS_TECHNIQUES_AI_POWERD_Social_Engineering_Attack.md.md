# Day 4: AI_Powerd Social Engineering Attack
Imagine receiving a phone or video call from your CEO, urgently instructing you to transfer funds to a new account to finalize a crucial business deal. Everything—from the voice and mannerisms to the background—appears entirely genuine.

In reality, this is not your CEO but a highly sophisticated deepfake created by cybercriminals using artificial intelligence. This scenario exemplifies a rising threat in cybersecurity: AI-driven social engineering attacks.

These attacks leverage artificial intelligence to enhance traditional social engineering techniques, making them more effective and harder to identify. AI enables cybercriminals to create highly realistic and personalized deceptions, blurring the distinction between legitimate and fraudulent communications.

While traditional social engineering relies on exploiting human psychology by imitating trusted figures or organizations, AI introduces an unprecedented level of realism. Advances in machine learning and deep learning allow for the creation of convincing fake content, such as deepfake videos and voice imitations, which significantly heightens the effectiveness of these attacks.

## Top phishing trends
- Phishing attacks surged by 58.2% in 2023 compared to the previous year, reflecting the growing sophistication and reach of threat actors.

- Voice phishing (vishing) and deepfake phishing attacks are on the rise as attackers harness generative AI tools to amplify their social engineering tactics.

- Adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing attacks persist and browser-in-the-browser (BiTB) attacks are emerging as a growing threat

## Top phishing targets

- The US, UK, India, Canada, and Germany were the top five countries targeted by phishing attacks.
