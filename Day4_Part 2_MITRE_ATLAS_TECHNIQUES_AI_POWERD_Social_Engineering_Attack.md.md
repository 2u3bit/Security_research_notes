# Day 4: AIPOWERD Social Engineering Attack
Imagine receiving a phone or video call from your CEO, urgently instructing you to transfer funds to a new account to finalize a crucial business deal. Everything—from the voice and mannerisms to the background—appears entirely genuine.

In reality, this is not your CEO but a highly sophisticated deepfake created by cybercriminals using artificial intelligence. This scenario exemplifies a rising threat in cybersecurity: AI-driven social engineering attacks.

These attacks leverage artificial intelligence to enhance traditional social engineering techniques, making them more effective and harder to identify. AI enables cybercriminals to create highly realistic and personalized deceptions, blurring the distinction between legitimate and fraudulent communications.

While traditional social engineering relies on exploiting human psychology by imitating trusted figures or organizations, AI introduces an unprecedented level of realism. Advances in machine learning and deep learning allow for the creation of convincing fake content, such as deepfake videos and voice imitations, which significantly heightens the effectiveness of these attacks.
